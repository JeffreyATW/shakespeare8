Romeo and Juliet

*** Adding Divya's version for cloning testing! Thank you!!! ***

In fair Cyber-Verona where we lay our scene...

SOME DUDE: I bite my thumb at you, sir. *bites thumb*

*shoots lasers*

JULIET: Ay, me! Lasers!

ROMEO: What light through yonder window breaks?

JULIET: Wherefor art thou, Romeo?

(More lasers)

THE END?
