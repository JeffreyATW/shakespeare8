Romeo and Juliet

In fair Cyber-Verona where we lay our scene...

O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circle orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
SOME DUDE: I bite my thumb at you, sir. *bites thumb*

*shoots lasers*

JULIET: Ay, me! Lasers!

ROMEO: What light through yonder window breaks?

JULIET: Wherefor art thou, Romeo?

(More lasers)

THE END?
